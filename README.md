# kinetic-parameter-optimization
In python language, the apparent kinetic parameters were optimized based on NSGA-III optimization algorithm.
NSGA3_kinetic_optimization.py serves as the primary implementation of the third-generation non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm, while utils.py constitutes the auxiliary subroutine code module.
